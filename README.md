# Next.js 15 Runtime Error: Accessing Undefined Variable

This repository demonstrates a common runtime error in Next.js 15 applications that occurs when a functional component attempts to access a variable that has not been defined.

## Description
The issue arises from referencing a variable that is undefined within the JSX of a functional component. This might happen due to typos, missing data fetching, or incorrect prop handling.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `pages` directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Run `npm run dev`.
5. Navigate to `/about`.

You will observe a runtime error in the browser's console.

## Solution
The solution involves careful variable handling to ensure that all variables accessed within JSX are properly defined. This might involve:
* Checking for the existence of the variable before using it.
* Using optional chaining (`?.`) to access properties safely.
* Correctly fetching and passing data as props.
* Removing the undefined variable.
